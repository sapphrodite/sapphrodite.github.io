            <p>
                For the past several months Iâ€™ve been writing a game engine using the ECS framework, a data-oriented approach to game development emphasizing composition and offering more flexibility than traditional object-oriented methods. There are two main advantages to an ECS architecture - first, its methods of abstraction reduce code duplication and lead to maintainable code. Second, data-oriented programming makes it far simpler to implement multithreading and optimize cache usage, two of the most important optimizations in modern computing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An ECS implementation consists of three different types of structures:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>
                    Entities are game objects, usually represented as integer IDs
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Components provide data and state to the entity they link with
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Systems operate on Components to process game logic, providing functionality..
                </li>
                
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                With ECS, different types of objects in the game world are no longer represented by unique classes - they are are instead represented by entities, and are given their various characteristics by components and systems. Components can also be added and removed at runtime - this allows for components to provide temporary modifiers e.g. a poison effect. Let's go through the constituent parts one by one and discuss implementation details.
