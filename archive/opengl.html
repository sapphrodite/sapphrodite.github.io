                Sprite batching is one of the most common and effective techniques for improving performance in video game renderers, referring to the process of rendering all sprites sharing a texture using a single draw call. Because sprites store vertices separately, this requires copying the data for all batched sprites into a large array that is sent once...  which might not seem like a speed improvement at first. If anything, one might naively say that this is in fact slower due to the extra cost of copying all the vertices. So, letâ€™s design a test to take a look at why batching is effective, and how to utilize it optimally.
