                        For the past several months I’ve been writing a game engine using the ECS framework, a data-oriented approach to game development that emphasizes composition and flexibility instead of traditional object-oriented methods. In my opinion, it’s more than just a programming technique - it’s a design philosophy that has its pros and cons just like everything else. Unfortunately, most articles on the subject are rather obtuse, and this was a struggle for me when first starting out. I’ve tried to include all the things I wanted to read before starting my engine, but I also cover the basics and give some extra tips.

                        First, the basics—ECS is a data-oriented architecture that utilizes composition and flexibility instead of object-oriented inheritance trees. The design philosophy is simple—Entities are game objects that are linked with Components, Components are structures of data that provide functionality to the entity they’re linked with, while Systems operate independently on Components to process the game’s data and logic. Objects in your world no longer have unique classes to represent them— entities are entirely compositional, with components being able to be added and removed at runtime - this allows for components to provide temporary modifiers e.g. a poison effect, for example. Entities are usually represented as a single integer ID, and methods of mapping entities components and systems together vary wildly—I’ll discuss different techniques and their rationales later on, but it’s important to remember that there’s no singular correct way to implement ECS.

                    <p>
                        First, the basics - ECS is an acronym for Entity, Component, System - the three constituent parts of its architecture. Unlike in OOP designs, different types of entities don’t have their own classes - almost all functionality and objects within your game will be represented through a combination of these.
                    </p>
                    
                    <span>
                        The design is simple:
                    </span>
                    
                    <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                            Entities are game objects, usually represented as integer IDs, that use Components to add and remove behavior at will
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            Components are structures of data that provide the functionality to the entity they’re linked with
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            Systems operate independently on Components to process the game’s data and logic.
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        As for my own reasons for adopting ECS, I was suffering from an incredibly common problem where the clunkiness of object-oriented inheritance trees lead to confusing spaghetti code, and a small change in one part of the program would sometimes break some seemingly unrelated functionality. In ECS, entities and components create a compositional relationship where shared functionality is factored out into distinct places - changes to one system rarely affects others. With this, code duplication is massively reduced and entire classes of bugs disappear. Bugfixing is simpler as well - most systems are completely independent of each other, and therefore any problems with a system must be contained within its own code.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The major downside of ECS is that the way it handles data isn’t compatible with several genres of games, and it tends to be overkill for most simpler games. The initial cost of switching can be rather high, but the ROI is usually quite worth it. I again have to emphasize that it’s
                        <em>
                            not for everyone
                        </em>
                        - don’t believe the zealots, and decide for yourself what’s right for you.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        On a personal note, I also find compositional relationships much easier to conceptualize - I made a graphic to illustrate the differences between ECS and inheritance, and the graphs looked the same because I drew the inheritance graph by breaking down complex systems into reusable parts, just like in ECS. Doing inheritance in this way is like a cheap imitation of true ECS with half the benefits, but if you decide to stick with an inheritance tree after reading this article, at least give it some sanity - favor composition!

                    <h2>How to Implement ECS</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        The internet peanut gallery constantly disagrees on the right way to link entities, components and systems together, and it’s my personal belief that this debate is utterly pointless - it’s all dependent on how the rest of your code works, and this is a judgment call that’s best made after sketching out the basic systems/components and the way they work. The core of an ECS engine is the relationship between these three constituents, and implementing anything outside of that is game dependent and I can’t speak to it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In order to allow for better cache locality and to promote system interdependence, components are typically pooled in contiguous memory using a data structure that can access, add and delete components in linear time.  Some implementations give systems ownership of the component pools they operate on, while others store all the pools in all one place and pass in the required pools when calling the system, and yet others (like mine) do a hybrid. This choice is completely up to you and can be changed at any time with relative ease as long as your interface doesn’t bleed implementation details.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Linking entities to the other parts of the engine is a task requiring some deliberation. Some designs register entities inside of systems and operate on that, while others create a mapping of entities to components - the important part is that each system can operate independently on contiguous blocks of components. In my eyes, this mapping is the core of the engine, and therefore should be arranged in a way that works well with the code of your systems.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In my implementation, “entity” is an alias for u32, and each component type has a numerical ID. Each entity has a bitmap to mark which components they have, and also a simple array indexed by component type ID to store the component object ID. It may not be the most elegant solution, but besides the simplicity advantage, storing the mapping data in an independent object allows me to pass it to systems to get other components linked to the same entity in constant time and without inter-thread data races. Whatever solution you pick, make sure it doesn’t make system implementation more difficult, or else even an elegant solution will be a slowdown.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        As an aside - I said that game objects don’t get their own classes, but this is not universally true. My rule of thumb is that world state doesn’t belong in ECS - both the tilemap and player-manager have their own classes, and it’s much cleaner than forcing the data into a paradigm where it doesn’t belong.

                        While there may not be a standard way to implement ECS, there’s plenty of mistakes that can prevent you from utilizing the full potential of your engine. ECS isn’t a holy grail, it’s merely a paradigm available for us to use, but that means absolutely nothing if you don’t know how to make the most of it. I’ll write a whole article on optimization later, but this part will be all about design decisions that enable optimization.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The most obvious improvement one can implement is multithreading, and ECS excels at this. I was quite surprised by how easy it was -  since I had designed my systems properly, all I had to do was run different systems in different threads! Multithreading can only be implemented
                        <em>
                            properly
                        </em>
                        by ensuring that systems are completely independent in memory writes - why slow it down with mutexes when avoiding it completely is so simple? If it truly needs to be written by multiple threads, try to find a non-blocking synchronization because burning cycles on synchronization is a waste of valuable time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        ECS is designed to avoid spaghetti code, but that doesn’t mean it’s immune - if you’re not careful, bad component design can quickly become a nasty problem. “Worse is Better” has no merit here, either do it the right way or don’t do it at all. In my first engine prototype, I implemented healthbar displays as part of the health component, and I figured this was fine since nothing else used the health component.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        As it turns out, I was dead wrong - since having health necessitated a healthbar, it was impossible to make crates display bullet holes when damaged instead of a healthbar. I could’ve continued the insanity and added both display methods to the health component, but the human brain has a fundamental inability to constantly keep a monolithic overdesigned system in working memory. Maximum granularity is absolutely necessary to benefit from the advantages of this architecture, and a much better choice is to make health displays their own component - with this you can use multiple displays, toggle them at will, and easily add more later.

                        As I've hopefully demonstrated in this article, ECS is a very useful tool for game design, providing flexibility, granularity and the potential for lots of optimizations. It's worth mentioning again that benefiting from the advantages of ECS is reliant on the quality of your implementation, and that it's not simply a hammer to bang in every programming nail. The underlying philosophy of composition is critical to ECS, and plenty of other applications can benefit from this design as well. Being able to map out relationships in maximum detail without having to resort to complicated and confusing hierarchy trees is a huge advantage, frees up lots of brain space, and will make your life a whole lot easier, even if it takes more code to set up.
