                For the past several months I’ve been writing a game engine using the ECS framework, a data-oriented approach to game development that emphasizes composition and flexibility instead of traditional object-oriented methods. In my opinion, it’s more than just a programming technique - it’s a design philosophy that has its pros and cons just like everything else. Unfortunately, most articles on the subject are rather obtuse, and this was a struggle for me when first starting out. I’ve tried to include all the things I wanted to read before starting my engine, but I also cover the basics and give some extra tips.
