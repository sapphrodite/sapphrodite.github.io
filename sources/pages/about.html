    <h2> About... </h2>
    <p>
        My name is Caroline D'Amato, and I'm a programmer with a strong passion for low-level optimization and efficiency. If there's one way to describe what I do with programming, I enjoy trying to create things that others can interact with, not tools that exist in a humanless void. That's part of why I made this blog, actually - it's a way to share some my experiences with others who might find them useful or interesting. What matters to me is people, not just numbers on a graph.

        I'll mostly be talking about my projects, but really I'll write about anything I find interesting enough. I unfortunately do most of my work in C++, but I'm on the lookout for a proper multi-paradigm alternative that's *truly* suitable for desktop application development - the fact that many Rust libraries are just poorly-made C bindings annoys me to no end.
