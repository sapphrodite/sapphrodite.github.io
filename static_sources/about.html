    <p>
        My name is Caroline D'Amato, and I'm a programmer with a strong passion for low-level optimization and efficiency. If there's one way to describe what I do with programming, I enjoy creating things that others can interact with, use. and get something out of, not tools that exist in a humanless void. That's why I made this blog, actually - it's a way to share some my experiences with others who might find them useful or interesting

Currently I have two main projects - a video game, and a pixel art editor dedicated to making art in the style of retro systems, as well as being directly compatibilite with those systems for homebrew developers. I'll mostly be talking about my projects, but really I'll write about anything I find interesting enough.
